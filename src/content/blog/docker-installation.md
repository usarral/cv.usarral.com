## Installing Docker

### Linux Distros with APT Package Manager

To install Docker on Linux distros like Ubuntu or Debian that use the APT package manager, you can do so with the following commands:

```sh
# Remove previous versions:
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

# Add packages to install and add the Docker repository
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent lsb-release

# Add the GPG key for the Docker repository
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

# Add the repository to our sources.list file, which is where APT queries the repositories to download programs
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Update repositories to detect the Docker repository
sudo apt update

# Install Docker and its dependencies
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

Configuration to use Docker without sudo:

```sh
# Add the user to the Docker group
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
# To use it without needing to restart, run the following command to "log in" to the group in the current session
newgrp docker
# Grant permissions to the Docker daemon socket
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

# Docker should now work; if it still doesn't, we need to restart the system
reboot now
```

### Windows

To install Docker on Windows:

1. Go to the [Docker website](https://docker.com).

2. Click on the download button for Windows.
3. Once downloaded, follow the installer.
4. Before running Docker, you will also need to install the WSL2 Kernel, which you can download [here](https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel).

5. Install this package, which will enable Docker virtualization.

## Basic Docker Commands

```sh
# Create a Docker container:
docker run -ti --name web ubuntu:latest
# Create a container with an open port:
# The format is LocalPort:ContainerPort
# By connecting to localhost:8000
# from our browser, we would connect
# to port 80 of the container
docker run --name web2 -ti -p 8000:80 web:v1
# Create a container with a shared folder
# The format is LocalFolder:FolderInContainer
docker run -ti --name web -ti -p 8000:80 -v C:\\Docker\\web:/var/www/html web:v1
# Create an image from a container:
# If we are inside the container, exit
# docker commit -m "Commit" containername repository:tag
docker commit -m "Image with Apache" web web:v1
# View images in Docker:
docker images
# View containers
docker ps -a

# Remove a container
docker rm web
# Connect to an already running container
docker exec -ti web bash
```
