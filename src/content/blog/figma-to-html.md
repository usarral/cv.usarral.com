Figma is an online user interface design tool that lets you create and design the appearance of your website. Itâ€™s intuitive and easy to use, and you can collaborate with other designers or clients in real-time.

Once you've finished designing your website in Figma, you can use the Builder.io plugin to export your design into browser code. Builder.io is a web page-building platform that converts your designs into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in seconds.

To use Builder.io, all you need to do is connect your Figma account and select the elements you want to export. Builder.io takes care of the rest, automatically generating the necessary code so your website looks and functions exactly as you designed it in Figma.

Once you've exported your design, you can use Vercel to publish your website. Vercel is a web development and hosting platform that allows you to easily publish your projects without server configuration or maintenance. You just need to upload your code, and Vercel handles the rest.

In summary, Figma, Builder.io, and Vercel are excellent tools for creating and publishing your website without writing code.
